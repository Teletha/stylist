     * </p>
     * <p>
     * In these examples, you can see the effect of scroll-margin by scrolling the output box to a
     * point partway between two of the "pages" of the example's content. The value specified for
     * scroll-margin determines how much of the page that's primarily outside the snapport should
     * remain visible.
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * Thus, the scroll-margin values represent outsets defining the scroll snap area that is used
     * for snapping this box to the snapport. The scroll snap area is determined by taking the
     * transformed border box, finding its rectangular bounding box (axis-aligned in the scroll
     * containerâ€™s coordinate space), then adding the specified outsets.

     * The scroll-padding-* properties define offsets for the optimal viewing region of the
     * scrollport: the region used as the target region for placing things in view of the user. This
     * allows the author to exclude regions of the scrollport that are obscured by other content
     * (such as fixed-positioned toolbars or sidebars), or simply to put more breathing room between
     * a targeted element and the edges of the scrollport.
